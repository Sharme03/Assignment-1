1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 ?

Ans:
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol.
HTTP is basis for almost all web applications.
HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information.

HTTP1.1 :
a) The first version of HTTP was created in 1997 and first version of HTTP was called HTTP1.1
b) Still we use HTTP1.1 in some web
c) HTTP1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it

HTTP2:
a) In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP2 was created.
b) HTTP2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1 especially during loading process.
c) In HTTP2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Ans:
Objects: 
a) Objects are most important data types of Javascript.
b) Objects are different from JavaScript’s primitive data types(i.e. Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol).
c) Primitive data types contains one value but objects can hold many values in form of keys.
d) Keys can be variable or functions and are called properties and methods respectively.
e) Forexample:
    var myCar = new Objects();
        myCar.make=”Suzuki”;
        myCar.model= “Altros”;
        myCar.year=1978;
 In this example myCar is object and the values inside the object is keys it can be accessed using these keys
